## Code Overview

- **ImageBrightnessCalculator.cs**: Main logic for calculating the brightness of the image. The brightness is calculated by averaging the RGB values of all pixels in the image and processing them into a single brightness score.
  
- **Form1.cs**: The WinForms UI containing the buttons, image display, and result text box.

## Libraries Used

- **System.Drawing**: For loading and processing image files.
- **System.Windows.Forms**: For creating the WinForms user interface.

Where the value represents the average brightness of the image, with higher values indicating brighter images.
